# Overview: 

The objective of assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

This webpage is to be hosted on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

This webpage contains the date that I have created the document, and it also contains a map created with Leaflet. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=28.4376538, lng= 77.2923329,16, popup="My Home - Navshakti Apartment")
my_map
```
